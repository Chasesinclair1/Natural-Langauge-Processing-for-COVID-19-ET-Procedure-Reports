# Natural-Langauge-Processing-for-COVID-19-ET-Procedure-Reports
Statistical learning and natural language processing on a database of patient safety reports, as an illustration of how data science could be valuable in this effort. The dataset contains two variables: report, which contains the text of the incident report, and outcome, which is a binary variable describing whether the incident resulted in death/injury, or was it asimple malfunction. If you read the reports you should be able to determine the outcome. However, my goal is to build a program that can predict the outcome by modeling the text of the incident report. I will perform text classification using a Simple Vector Machine, for both DTM and LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis). For each combination, I will generate 1000 independent random partitions of the data into training and test data. Then I will use the training sample to train the SVM classifiers and then use the trained SVM classifier to predict classes for the test data.
